# Console-Finances
Why did you build this project? I build this project to create code for analysing the financial records of a company. To analyse the following: 
* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

What problem does it solve? This will allow the user to easily analyse and manipulate the data, without having do manual caluations on the figures provided. 

What did you learn? From this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of 'arrays' and more experience in creating and using 'for loops' in JavaScript.
